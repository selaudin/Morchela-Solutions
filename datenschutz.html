This data protection statement provides information on what personal data we collect, for what purpose and to whom we pass it on. We regularly review and update this privacy policy to ensure the highest level of transparency.</p><br><h2>1. What services we use</h2><p></p><ul><li><span>Google Maps</span></li></ul><p></p><br><h2>2. Contact Information</h2><p>If you have any questions or concerns about our protection of your data, you can always reach us by email at info@morchela.com. Responsible for data processing done through this website is:</p><br><p>Morchela Solutions GmbH<br>Klingentalstrasse 47<br>4057 Basel<br>Switzerland<br><br><br><br><br></p><br><h2>3. General principles</h2><h3>3.1 What data we collect from you and from whom we receive this data</h3><p>First and foremost, we process personal data that you provide to us or that we collect when operating our website. We may also receive personal data about you from third parties. These may be the following categories:</p><ul><li>Personal master data (name, address, dates of birth, etc.);</li><li>Contact information (cell phone number, email address, etc.);</li><li>Financial data (e.g. account details);</li><li>Online identifiers (e.g. cookie identifier, IP addresses);</li><li>Location and traffic data;</li><li>Sound and image recording;</li><li>particularly sensitive data (e.g. biometric data or information about your health).</li></ul><br><h3>3.2 Under what conditions do we process your data?</h3><p>We process your data in good faith and for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. In doing so, we ensure transparent and proportionate processing.<br><br>If, in exceptional cases, we are unable to comply with these principles, the data processing may still be lawful because there is a justification. A justification reason may be in particular:</p><ul><li>Your consent;</li><li>the execution of a contract or pre-contractual measures;</li><li>our legitimate interests, unless your interests are overridden.</li></ul><br><h3>3.3 How can you withdraw your consent?</h3><p>If you have given us consent to process your personal data for specific purposes, we will process your data within the scope of this consent unless we have another justification.<br><br>You can revoke your consent at any time by sending an e-mail to the address given in the imprint. Data processing that has already taken place is not affected by this.</p><br><h3>3.4 In which cases can we share your data with third parties?</h3><br><h4>a. Principle</h4><p>We may need to rely on the services of third parties or affiliates and engage them to process your data (known as processors). Categories of recipients are namely:</p><ul><li>Accounting, fiduciary and auditing firm;</li><li>Consulting firms (legal, tax, etc.);</li><li>IT service provider (web hosting, support, cloud services, website design, etc.);</li><li>Payment service provider;</li><li>Provider of tracking, conversion and advertising services.</li></ul><br><p>We ensure that these third parties and our affiliates comply with the requirements of data protection and treat your personal data confidentially.<br><br>We may also be required to disclose your personal information to government authorities.</p><br><h4>b. Visiting our social media channels</h4><p>We may have embedded links to our social media channels on our website. This is apparent to you in each case (typically via corresponding icons). If you click on the icons, you will be redirected to our social media channels.<br><br>In this case, the social media providers learn that you are accessing their platform from our website. The social media providers can use the data collected in this way for their own purposes. We would like to point out that we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by the operators.</p><br><h4>c. Transfer abroad</h4><p>Under certain circumstances, your personal data may be transferred to companies abroad in the course of order processing. These companies are obligated to data protection to the same extent as we are. The transfer may take place worldwide.<br><br>If the level of data protection does not correspond to that in Switzerland, we carry out a prior risk assessment and ensure contractually that the same level of protection is guaranteed as in Switzerland (for example, by means of the new standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or other legally prescribed measures). If our risk assessment is negative, we take additional technical measures to protect your data. You can access the EU Commission's standard contractual clauses at the following link. https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-controllers-and-processors-eueea_de</p><br><h3>3.5 How long do we keep your data?</h3><p>We store personal data only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the individual purposes for which the data was collected.<br><br>Data that we store when you visit our website is kept for twelve months. An exception is made for analysis and tracking data, which may be kept longer.<br><br>We store contract data for longer, as we are obliged to do so by legal regulations. In particular, we must retain business communications, concluded contracts and accounting records for up to 10 years. As far as we no longer need such data from you to perform the services, the data will be blocked and we will only use it for accounting and tax purposes.</p><br><h3>3.6 How do we protect your data?</h3><p>We will keep your information secure and take all reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, access, misuse or alteration.<br><br>Our contractual partners and employees who have access to your data are obliged to comply with data protection regulations. In some cases, it will be necessary for us to pass on your requests to companies affiliated with us. In these cases, too, your data will be treated confidentially.<br><br>Within our website, we use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) procedure in conjunction with the highest encryption level supported by your browser.</p><br><h3>3.7 What rights do you have?</h3><br><h4>a. Right to information</h4><p>You can request information about the data we have stored about you at any time. We ask you to send your request for information together with proof of identity to info@morchela.com.<br><br>You also have the right to receive your data in a common file format if we process your data automatically and if:</p><ul><li>you have given your consent for the processing of this data; or</li><li>you have disclosed data in connection with the conclusion or performance of a contract.</li></ul><p>We may restrict or refuse to provide information or data if this conflicts with our legal obligations, our own legitimate interests, public interests or the interests of a third party.<br><br>The processing of your request is subject to the statutory processing period of 30 days. However, we may extend this period due to a high volume of requests, for legal or technical reasons, or because we need more detailed information from you. You will be informed of the extension of the deadline in good time, at least in text form.</p><br><h4>b. Deletion and correction</h4><br><p>You have the option of requesting the deletion or correction of your data at any time. We may reject the request if statutory provisions oblige us to store the data for a longer period or to retain it unchanged or if your request conflicts with a legal requirement.<br><br>Please note that exercising your rights may be in conflict with contractual agreements and may have corresponding effects on the performance of the contract (e.g. premature termination of the contract or cost consequences).</p><br><h4>c. Legal process</h4><p>If you are affected by the processing of personal data, you have the right to enforce your rights in court or to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. The competent supervisory authority in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch</p><br><h3>3.8 Changes to the privacy policy</h3><p>We may change this privacy policy at any time.
